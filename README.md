##Welcome to the HTML5 training!
You must install Git in order to progress through the training. Please see the [Git download and installation information](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for installing Git on your machine.

This will be a hands on training. You should have a modern browser and a text editor of your choice installed.
